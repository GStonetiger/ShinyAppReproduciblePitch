# Shiny App and Reproducible Pitch

## This shiny app demonstrate following statements in action.

**
The t distribution, invented by William Gosset in 1908, has thicker tails than the normal. Also, instead of having two parameters, mean and variance, as the normal does, the t distribution has only one - the number of degrees of freedom (df). 

As df increases, the t distribution gets more like a standard normal, so it's centered around 0.**
